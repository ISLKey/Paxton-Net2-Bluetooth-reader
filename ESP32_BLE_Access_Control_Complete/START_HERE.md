# 🚀 ESP32 BLE Access Control System

**Welcome!** You've just downloaded a complete Bluetooth Low Energy access control system for ESP32.

---

## ⚡ What This Does

Turns your ESP32 into a **Bluetooth-to-Access-Control bridge** that:

✅ Detects your smartphone/BLE beacon  
✅ Converts it to a Wiegand or EM4100 credential  
✅ Sends it to your access control panel  
✅ **Unlocks the door automatically!**

**No RFID cards needed** - just walk up with your phone! 📱

## ⚡ Super Quick Start (For the Impatient)

### 1️⃣ Wire It Up (2 minutes)
```
ESP32          Access Panel
GPIO 25  ───►  D0 (Data0)
GPIO 26  ───►  D1 (Data1)
GND      ───►  GND (0V)
```

### 2️⃣ Configure It (3 minutes)
Edit `ble_wiegand_access_control.ino`:
```cpp
#define OUTPUT_FORMAT 26  // 26=Wiegand26, 34=Wiegand34, 40=EM4100

const char* authorizedDevices[] = {
  "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",  // Your phone's MAC address
};
```

### 3️⃣ Upload It (5 minutes)
- Install Arduino IDE + ESP32 support
- Open the .ino file
- Click Upload button

### 4️⃣ Test It! (1 minute)
- Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
- Walk up with your phone
- Watch it unlock! 🎉

## 🎛️ Supported Formats

| Format | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wiegand 26-bit** | Most common, works with 99% of systems |
| **Wiegand 34-bit** | Large installations, more unique IDs |
| **EM4100 40-bit** | EM4100 readers with Clock & Data output |

**Not sure?** Use **Wiegand 26-bit** (it's the standard).

---

## 🔧 What You Need

### Hardware ($10-20)
- ✅ ESP32 board (any model)
- ✅ USB cable
- ✅ 3 jumper wires
- ✅ Your existing access control panel

### Software (Free)
- ✅ Arduino IDE
- ✅ Python 3 (for credential converter)
- ✅ USB drivers (may be needed)

---

## 📱 How to Find Your Phone's MAC Address

### Android
1. Settings → About Phone → Status
2. Look for "Bluetooth Address"
3. Write it down (e.g., `A4:C1:38:AB:CD:EF`)

### iPhone
1. Download "LightBlue" app (free)
2. Use another device to scan for your iPhone
3. Note the MAC address shown

### BLE Beacon
- Usually printed on the device
- Or check the product documentation

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

Before you start:

1. ⚡ **Never connect ESP32 to 12V** - Use only 5V power
2. 🔌 **Disconnect panel power** before wiring
3. 🔒 **This is for low-medium security** - MAC addresses can be spoofed
4. 📖 **Read the safety section** in WIRING_DIAGRAM.md

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Upload fails | Install USB drivers (see INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) |
| No BLE detection | Check MAC address format (use colons) |
| Panel doesn't respond | Verify wiring and format selection |
| Wrong credentials | Use mac_to_credential.py tool |

**Full troubleshooting**: See INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting section
